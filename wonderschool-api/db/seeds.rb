# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)


# 
# Task.create(group: "Purchases", task: "Go to the bank")
# Task.create(group: "Purchases", task: "Buy hammer")
# Task.create(group: "Purchases", task: "Buy wood", dependencyIds: '{1}')
# Task.create(group: "Purchases", task: "Buy nails", dependencyIds: '{1}')
# Task.create(group: "Purchases", task: "Buy paint", dependencyIds: '{1}')
# Task.create(group: "Build Airplane", task: "Hammer nails into wood", dependencyIds: '{2,3,4}')
# Task.create(group: "Build Airplane", task: "Paint wings", dependencyIds: '{5,6}')
# Task.create(group: "Build Airplane", task: "Have a snack" )
